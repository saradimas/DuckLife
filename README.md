# DuckLife
This project was for a school challenge and we had 10 nights for it. Our idea was of a completely different game, unfortunately/fortunately we had to change the project at the 6th day, so we only had 4 days to do it. It's a very simple game and it's not completed, but I hope you enjoy it.
